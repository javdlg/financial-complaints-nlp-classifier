# 🎫 Intelligent Customer Support Ticket Routing System

### 📋 Project Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automate the classification and prioritization of customer support tickets. By analyzing unstructured text data from customer queries, the system predicts the appropriate **department** (e.g., Billing, Technical Support) and assigns a **priority level**, aiming to reduce response times and optimize support team workflows.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Automate Routing:** Reduce manual triage by accurately classifying tickets.
* **NLP Pipeline:** Implement a robust text processing pipeline including tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.
* **Business Intelligence:** Visualize ticket trends and model performance using **Power BI**.
* **Deployment:** Interactive demo using **Streamlit** for real-time classification.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Spacy, Streamlit.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI.
* **Dataset:** Customer Support Ticket Dataset (Kaggle).
